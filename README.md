# Unity-VFX-Graph-Sun

A basic Unity VFX Graph Sun.

Not memory optimised. Uses two sets of graphs, one for the sun and one for the sun's corona and flares.

The sun's corona and flares graph position is set to 'Circle', useful for a "fixed" camera position.

Change its position to 'Sphere' if a 360 view is desired.

Total of 1 mil particles.
