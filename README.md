# Unity-VFX-Graph-Sun

A basic Universal Render Pipeline Unity VFX Graph Sun. Tested with URP 7.3.1, Unity 2019.4.8f1, VFX 7.3.1.

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m670NQ5JrNI&feature=youtu.be

Not memory optimised. Uses two sets of graphs, one for the sun and one for the sun's corona and flares.

The sun's corona and flares graph position is set to 'Circle', useful for a "fixed" camera position.

Change its position to 'Sphere' if a 360 view is desired, and adjust Vector Feild Force settings (particularly Center and Intensity values).

A post processing asset is included for a bloom effect.

Total of 1 mil particles.
